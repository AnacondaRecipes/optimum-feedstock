  description: |
    ðŸ¤— Optimum is an extension of Transformers that provides a set of performance optimization tools to train and run models on targeted hardware with maximum efficiency.
    The AI ecosystem evolves quickly, and more and more specialized hardware along with their own optimizations are emerging every day. 
    As such, Optimum enables developers to efficiently use any of these platforms with the same ease inherent to Transformers.
